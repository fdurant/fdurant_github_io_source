Hello! My name is Frederik Durant, I'm a native from [Brussels, Belgium][brussels]. From January through April 2015, I'm taking a self-sponsored sabbatical from [Nuance Communications][nuance], where I work as R&D Manager of Natural Language Understanding in the Automotive domain. Seventy-five percent of my sabbatical is devoted to a 12-week [Data Science Bootcamp][metis-datascience] at [Metis][metis] in the amazing city of New York.

This .data ("dot data") blog is here to share my experiences before, during and after this sabbatical. You can expect stories on professional (data science) as well as more personal topics (such as life in NYC & Brooklyn, where I stay at the [Krash][krash] co-housing facility).

Why .data as a name? Well, I started my career in the early [dotcom][dotcom] era. These days of data (science) hype somehow remind me of them, that's all. And it surely allows for a nice logo :-)
