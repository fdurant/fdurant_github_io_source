Hello! My name is Frederik Durant, I'm a native from [Brussels, Belgium][brussels].

From January through April 2015, I took a self-sponsored sabbatical from [Nuance Communications][nuance], where I worked as R&D Manager of Natural Language Understanding in the Automotive domain. The larger part of my sabbatical was devoted to a 12-week [Data Science Bootcamp][metis-datascience] at [Metis][metis] in the amazing city of New York.

This .data ("dot data") blog saw the light in order to share my experiences before, during and after this sabbatical.

After the bootcamp, I returned home and took up a job as [Staff Member in Data Innovation at Colruyt Group][colruyt], Belgium's largest food retailer.

Why .data as a name? Well, I started my career in the early [dotcom][dotcom] era. These days of data (science) hype somehow remind me of them, that's all. And it surely allows for a nice logo :-)
