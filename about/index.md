Hello! My name is Frederik Durant, I'm a native from [Brussels, Belgium][brussels].

This .data ("dot data") blog saw the light in December 2014. At the
time, I was preparing for a 12-week [Data Science
Bootcamp][metis-datascience] at [Metis][metis] in the amazing city of
New York.

After the bootcamp, I returned home and went to work as [Staff Member
in Data Innovation at Colruyt Group][colruyt], Belgium's largest food
retailer.

From September 2018 to August 2020, I commuted weekly between Brussels and
London. From Monday morning to Friday evening, I was
a Sr. Data Scientist at [Aire Labs][airelabs] in Shoreditch.
And then Covid-19 sent me home.

In August 2020, I joined [Ester][ester] as co-founder and CTO.
