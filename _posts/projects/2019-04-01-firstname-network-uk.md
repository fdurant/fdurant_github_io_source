After a herculean [data collection][data_source] effort spanning no
less than two decades (1996-2015), the world-renowned [European
Research Group][erg] have today published their ground-breaking
longitudinal study on British baby names. Despite lavish
funds provided by a [European Union research grant][eu_research_innovation],
publication of the results took somewhat longer to deliver
than foreseen.

One research finding immediately stands out: the immense, consistent yet wholly
unexpected impopularity of _Brexit_ as a baby name.

Indeed, to the utter astonishment of the [global (yes, _global_)][global_britain]
research community, British parents have overwhelmingly preferred more
euphonic names:
_Euron_, _Euros_, _Eugene_ and _Euan_, not to mention
_Britney_. However, _not a single_ [baby boy][pdf_boys] or [baby
girl][pdf_girls] was christened _Brexit_.


The following table says it all:

| *First name* | *Frequency (Boys)* | *Frequency (Girls)* | *TOTAL* |
|Euan|4860|0|4860|
|Britney|0|999|999|
|Eugene|384|0|384|
|Eunice|0|277|277|
|Eugenia|0|72|72|
|Eugenio|6|0|6|
|Euron|5|0|5|
|Euros|3|0|3|
|**Brexit**|**0**|**0**|**0**|

## Bored already? Time for a somewhat related video

## OK, back to science now

Asked for a scientific explanation,
[ERG][erg] lead scientist dr. Made-Up Cheese-Smog was quick to pinpoint
the limited scope of the study. The truth is: as soon as the
[well-informed UK people][well_informed] had decided in 2016 to leave
the EU, European funds had dried up, almost overnight. Also, desperate
pleas for bridge funding to the [Cayman Islands 
government][cayman_gov] had been unsuccessful. As a result,
post-2015 baby names had not been included in the study, causing
a completely understandable divergence between hallucinatory
delusions and common-sense reality.

In short: _Brexit could have meant Brexit_. Only it didn't.

Despite all these setbacks, the [European Research Group][erg] have no
plans to give up. On the contrary, a follow-up study is
already in preparation. As dr. Cheese-Smog explained, both the striking
uniformity of _Brexit's_ longitudinal distribution and its intriguing
gender neutrality (zero occurrences for [boys][pdf_boys] _as well as_
for [girls][pdf_girls]) do require further research. 

Anyway, since the recent [trade deal with Switzerland and
Liechtenstein][trade_deal], money's not an issue anymore. That's
sorted then.
