    <p>A few weeks ago, I made a microloan to political management student Yaqout from Al Hashmiya, Jordan.
      Twenty-three other lenders from around the globe did
      the same, for a total of $725. Yaqout will use this sum to
      finance her next semester.</p>

    <p><img src="/images/yakout_from_jordan.jpg"/></p>

    <p>The loan was facilitated by <a href="http://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a>, a microfinance
      platform that has
      been around since 2005. In these ten years, hundreds of thousands of borrowers like Yaqout have applied for a loan by
      telling their <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lend/844974" target="_blank">personal story</a> and describing
      their ambitions and plans.</p>

      <p>As it happens, Kiva <a href="http://build.kiva.org/">meticulously gathers all these stories,
	and makes them available to the world</a> for further application development and research. So we had a look!</p>

    <h2>Semantic modelling as a subgoal of natural language processing</h2>

    <p>Over the past 2 1/2 weeks, the Metis Data Science Bootcamp
      introduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>
      (= NLP, not to be confused with
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" target="_blank">Neuro-Linguistic Programming</a>).</p>

    <p>One subgoal of NLP is to make it easy for humans to process huge amounts of textual data. While every earthling nowadays
      routinely uses <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">text search</a> (a.k.a. information retrieval),
      getting an insight into the contents of massive data collections is still less common to the public at large.
      Yet, over the last 20 years,
      technologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing">latent semantic indexing</a> and
      more recently <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf" target="_blank">probabilistic topic
	models</a> have been developed to precisely address this need.</p>

    <h2>Kiva borrower stories at a glance</h2>

    <p>The <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373">zoomable
    sunburst</a> depicted below offers a bird's-eye view into 775
    thousand Kiva borrower stories. Each of the 64 outer segments 
    represents one core topic, which is expressed as a probability distribution over a vocabulary of 1000 words (excluding stop
      words and other very frequent words). From these
      1000 words, only the <em>seven</em> most prominent ones are shown for each topic.
      The inner segments represent successive higher-abstract groupings of the core topics.</p>

    <p>The breadcrumb arrow at the top left-hand side shows the path of all most prominent words visited, as you traverse
      the hierarchy from the central circle to the outer rings, and back.</p>

    <p>The size of each segment represents the presence of this topic in the whole collection, i.e. across
      <em>all</em> borrower stories. In probabilistic topic modelling, each document is indeed seen as having
      been generated by a probabilistic drawing from <em>all</em> topics in the data collection - with some
      topics being more prominent than others, for each document at hand. Otherwise stated:
      no single document has an <em>exclusive</em> relationship to a
      single topic, and vice versa.</p>

    <p>The colors have no other purpose than to serve visual distinctiveness.</p>

    <h2>The topic modelling process</h2>

    <p>Please refer to
    our <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fdurant/kiva_project/blob/master/hierarchical_topic_modelling_of_kiva_loan_descriptions.ipynb"
    target="_">iPython notebook</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/fdurant/kiva_project"
    target="_">GitHub repository</a> for all details of the topic
    modelling process, up to the production of the topic hierarchy.</p>
    
    <p>For visualizing the topic hierarchy , we used the <a href="http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/about">Hierarchie</a>
      system developed at/by the <a href="http://www.dac.us/">Decisive Analytics Corporation</a>.</p>
