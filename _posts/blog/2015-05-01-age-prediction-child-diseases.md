In this [(second) machine age][second-machine-age], it was only a matter of time before
machines would start guessing our age. Researchers from Microsoft have
recently released an online tool called "[How Old Do I
Look?][how-old]". When given a photo, the tool will not only tell you how
old you are, but also your gender.

Since one is never too old to learn
&mdash; especially about oneself &mdash; I gave
it a go. Contrary to this [rather biased article in The
Guardian][guardian-how-old], I wanted to use more than a single
data point per person to evaluate the predictor's quality. (Data) Science oblige!

<img style="clear:both; float:right; margin:5px" width="75" src="/images/microsoft_how_old/actual_45_estimated_54_460x560px.png"/>
Enter my often mocked selfie archive, painstakenly collected over the
years for exactly this kind of scientific purpose. Thirteen pictures
from the last year were pseudo-randomly selected, with some variation in
hairstyle, location, sunlight, season, hours of sleep, bespectacledness, and headwear.

<img style="clear:both; float:right; margin:5px" width="75" src="/images/microsoft_how_old/actual_45_estimated_54_580x700px.png"/>
Let's start with the good news: in 13 out of 13 cases, my gender was determined as
being of the **male** kind. To whom it may concern, and for the record: this prediction is **100%
congruent with the actual situation**.

<img style="clear:both; float:right; margin:5px" width="75" src="/images/microsoft_how_old/actual_45_estimated_55_420x540px.png"/>
Then again, according to Microsoft, my **average age** over the last year
was (38 + 39 + 42 + 43 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 48 + 54 + 54 + 55 + 55 + 58) /
13 = **47,8** years. This is **almost 2 years more than the actual**
average age I had when the photos were taken. Not brilliant, but not
that bad either, given the relatively small test sample size.

<img style="clear:both; float:right; margin:5px" width="75" src="/images/microsoft_how_old/actual_45_estimated_55_470x570px.png"/>
With a **standard deviation** of **6.7 years** (about 1/7 of the
average), the age predictor does allow itself a fair amount of
variability. As the saying goes: _with age comes wisdom, but sometimes age comes
alone._ I'm talking about the predictor, of course &mdash; it may
still have some child diseases to outgrow.

On a less serious and scientific note: both my daughters will no doubt revel in joy that **funny hats** do not make a
middle-aged person &mdash; let alone a father &mdash; look any
younger. Quite the contrary.
