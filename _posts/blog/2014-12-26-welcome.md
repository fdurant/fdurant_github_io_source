It's been almost half a decade since my [last blog post](http://blog.prompt-speechapps.com), so high time for a restart.

Two weeks from now, I'll be travelling to New York for a 12-week [Data Science Bootcamp][metis-datascience] organized by [Metis][metis]. During that period, I'll be living at the [Brooklyn Krashpad][krash], a co-housing facility for entrepreneurs, creative people and other types of lifelong learners and doers.

Since visualization, presentation and communication form an integral part of data science, I plan to share my learnings, insights and other adventures via these pages.

So thanks for visiting, and stay tuned!
