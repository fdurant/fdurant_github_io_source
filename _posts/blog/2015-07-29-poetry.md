# Memories

> Through the veil of time<br/>
> Distant features once so close<br/>
> Glimmer on the mind

# City walls

> High on the rooftops<br/>
> Water towers bleed to death<br/>
> Staining the brownstones

# Broken light

> On the window sill<br/>
> The glass shines, filled with moonbeams<br/>
> scattered on the floor

# Winter

> Snowflake by snowflake<br/>
> Early spring's nipped in the bud<br/>
> Flowers in the clouds

# Moments

> From tomorrow on<br/>
> Yesterday won't be the same<br/>
> as it was today
