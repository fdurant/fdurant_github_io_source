# Zero Dot One

> How far is it yet?<br/>
> Abundance of decimals<br/>
> From zero to one

# Intelligent design

> Stub out the modules<br/>
> Lest their numb interfaces<br/>
> Develop bit rot

# Black hole attraction

> Shiny bright feedback<br/>
> Around the moon it travels<br/>
> Into outer space

# Code improv

> Go pick up the lines<br/>
> Pull, change, commit, push and merge<br/>
> To his master's branch

# Pair programming

> I'll do the typing<br/>
> Insists the Siamese twin<br/>
> While you think for two

# Shift left right

> Pickled Arabic<br/>
> Curly braced Python objects<br/>
> Eating their own tail

# Curtain Road Works

> Jackhammers drilling<br/>
> As noisy signals erupt<br/>
> Compressed Aire explodes
