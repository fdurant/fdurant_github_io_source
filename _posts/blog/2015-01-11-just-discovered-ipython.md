While doing the statistics prework (reading and exercises) for the [Metis Data Science bootcamp][metis-datascience],
I got to know [IPython][ipython], a *great* tool/architecture for interactive computing and on-the-fly visualization and publishing.

I'm ashamed to say that IPython has been around for a *decade* without my noticing it.
Which only shows how much this sabbatical was overdue :-)

To see IPython at work, check out
some example IPython notebooks on the [nbviewer service][nbviewer].

Or if you have more time:

By the way, I got <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/71+Irving+Pl,+Brooklyn,+NY+11238/@40.6830384,-73.9596046,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25bbd564b66a1:0x3dd32d62a569e278">here</a> alright.
