One of my favorite pastimes since I was a philology student in the late eighties has
been, rather unsurprisingly, to visit bookstores. In my [student][kuleuven] town [Leuven][leuven], I spent
hours - and tons of money - at [Boekhandel Peeters][peeters], specialized in the liberal
arts. For computing and other
so-called hard sciences, Wouters was my 
preferred place to go. It sadly [went bankrupt][wouters_bust] in 2006,
when it was swallowed by the cooperative [Acco][acco], itself founded in
1960.

In 1995, just after I started my professional career, [Jeff
Bezos][jeff_bezos] founded [Amazon.com][amazon]. The brick-and-mortar
bookstore as we knew it was indeed never going to be the same. In the
US, super-bookstore chain [Borders][borders] [didn't adapt fast
enough][borders_5reasons], started going downhill and finally
[disappeared][borders_bust] in 2011. [Barnes & Noble][barnes_noble]
gobbled them up.

As much as I appreciate Amazon's search capabilities and limitless offering, I
still prefer the smell and touch of physical books and, by extension,
bookstores. For the latter, on the condition that they have **something extra** to
offer. That can be a combination of:

- a choice adapted to my specialized taste - quality always trumping quantity
- a [club chair][club_chair], vital for bringing the <strike>buyer</strike> reader in the correct mental state
- a cup of coffee or tea, with or without [madeleine][madeleine] (or similar)
- *à la limite*, silent whispers from the other *flâneurs*

Yesterday, I was lucky enough to discover such a place in the [Librairie
Albertine][albertine]. The whole atmosphere breathes *luxe, calme et volupté*, as [Charles B.][baudelaire] would say.

Other bookstores that I particularly recommend include:

- [Passa Porta][passa_porta] and [Tropismes][tropismes] in Brussels
- [Barnes & Noble on 5th Avenue][barnes_noble_5th_av] in New York City
- [The MIT Press Bookstore][mit_press] and [Harvard Bookstore][harvard] in Cambridge, MA

Ironically, Amazon.com recently announced [plans to open
hundreds of **physical** bookstores][amazon_announcement].

I fear the worst, but hope for the best!
