# Coffee break

> @ [Caf√© Victor][bozar_cafe_victor]<br/>
> Flippant & Old intruders<br/>
> White shirts, flat wallets

# Agile visions

> Cost, quality, scope<br/>
> Multi-layered crystal balls<br/>
> Push the door, pick two

# Unit testing

> Inputs and outputs<br/>
> Paths shrouded in mystery<br/>
> An amazing maze

# House of cards

> Hold your ace and wait<br/>
> But I want to play it now<br/>
> Earthquake &mdash; told you so

# No kidding

> Managers manage<br/>
> Programmers program &mdash; that is<br/>
> Indeed, what they do

# Recursive chat

> Am I a robot?<br/>
> Maybe I am, maybe not<br/>
> Let me ask myself

# Multilingual language models

> Vectors and trigrams<br/>
> Go ahead, just talk to me<br/>
> Know what I'm saying?
