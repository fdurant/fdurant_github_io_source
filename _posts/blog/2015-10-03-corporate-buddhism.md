# Conference call

> Everybody go on mute<br/>
> One hour full of silence<br/>
> Now that's a brainstorm

# Work

> There's no I in 'team'<br/>
> They say - and no U either<br/>
> Then why are we here?

# Project planning

> So many milestones<br/>
> Along the critical path<br/>
> To stumble upon

# Acceleration

> Faster and faster<br/>
> Time reduced to one moment<br/>
> Absolute standstill

# Hierarchy

> With each new layer<br/>
> The game of Chinese whispers<br/>
> Beautifies the truth
