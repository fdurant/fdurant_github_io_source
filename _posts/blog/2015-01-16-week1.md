My first week in New York is coming to an end. Here's what an average weekday has looked like, so far:

- Out of bed way too early, between 1-4 AM, breakfast around 6-7 AM
- [Public transport][mta-map] from [Krash Brooklyn][krash-brooklyn] to [Metis][metis-address] in Midtown Manhattan:
  - Walk to Clinton/Washington station (5 minutes)
  - C line to West 4th Street / Washington Square station (9 stops, about 20 minutes)
  - B/D/F/M line to 34th Street / Herald Square station (3 stops, about 5 minutes)
  - Walk to Metis at 79 Madison Ave (10 minutes)
- Class from 9AM until noon, first theory (project design, hypothesis testing, git & GitHub), then practical lab work (like the [hipster classification game](/blog/hipster-or-not/))
- Lunch from noon until 1:30 PM. There's an _overwhelming_ choice out there. So far, I've tried [Eataly][eataly], [Essen][essen], [Bread & Butter][b&b], a Korean takeaway, plus a few more
- Afternoon class with more practical lab work, until 6 PM +/- 1 hour. Working with [MTA turnstile data][mta-turnstile-data] this week. Also found publicly available [School Point Location][school-point-location-data] data, and installed [ArcGIS][arcgis] for mapping MTA stations and schools. All our code and artifacts are stored at [GitHub](https://github.com/fdurant/NewYorkRedBulls).
- Dinner in Manhattan with fellow Krashers, or straight home
- In Brooklyn: Shopping at local deli, doing the dishes, watching [wacky TV series](http://www.cc.com/shows/broad-city) on Netflix/Amazon

Other random activities and observations:

- Walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan, over the Brooklyn Bridge
- Walked up Fifth Avenue from Madison Square Park to Central Park
- Bought some garments at Macy's. Hmm, those trousers do look a bit too short, after all
- Had a swim try-out at the [Manhattan Plaza Health Club][mphc]. Water temperature OK, out-of-water temperature not OK.
- Despite our 90-minute lunch break, fellow students eat and walk to/from the eatery at great _speed_, for no apparent reason
