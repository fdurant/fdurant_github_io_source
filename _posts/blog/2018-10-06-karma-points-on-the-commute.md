After twenty years of splendid isolation in despicable company cars, I
recently joined the ranks of the daily commuters. I'm not a
big fan of loyalty cards, but still: in no time have my green and
social karma scores reached an all-time high. Wholly undeserved, I
must admit.

Because, I ask you: what could possibly be more delightful than
spending thirty minutes in the intimate presence of perfect strangers &mdash; _twice a day?_
The daily journey from my flat to work and back is _such_ a rewarding
experience &mdash; it would make the most ardent atheist start begging for
reincarnation.

Now, not sharing an opportunity for cosmic harmony would be utterly
selfish. Therefore, at the risk of preaching to the choir, allow me
to spread the Word of the [Tube][tube].

It all starts at the Gates.

Like spermatozoa racing towards the ovum, my fellow
commuters and I swiftly maneuver our way through the 
masses. Whilst looking for our [Oyster card][oystercard] &mdash; how
aptly named! &mdash; we desperately try to avoid the
inevitable collision. Where are the roundabouts when you need them?
Anyway, with ever growing anticipated joy, we get in line. One
redemptive blink of the green light, and we wrestle ourselves through
the Gates. Kind of a [jade egg][jade_egg] experience, [so I'm
told][gwyneth], but at a mere fraction of the cost.

Down on the platform, the brilliant self-organising
spectacle continues as we queue up once more, now neatly in _double_
lines. Spurred by motivational messages from the station manager
&mdash; "Have an amazing day!" &mdash; and carefully [minding the Gap of
Death][mind_the_gap], I finally make it onto the Train of Life. This is what birth must
have felt like, had I paid a bit more attention.

Once inside, spontaneous Chants of Praise screaming from the
neighbors' headphones fill my ears with enchantment. Tears of joy follow
when, like a Sign from Above, the aircon blows away any remaining
doubts and worries. How wonderful to sneeze as I feel the Breeze of
Freeze, right there, down my neck.

While reaching out for the yellow handle to stay on my feet, I generously
offer my vertically challenged co-passenger an olphactory glimpse into
my Axe-sprayed armpit. Gratefully, she retaliates by spilling hot
coffee on my trousers. So much human warmth, you can't imagine.

Fortunately, at each station, more and more passengers get stuffed
onto the Godly Carriage. There definitely is a place for _everyone_ on
the Train of Eternity. #YouToo, #MeToo, the more the merrier.

Alas, just as Nirvana comes within reach, the Heavenly Horses
approach my final destination &mdash; at least in this life. Sweatily stumbling
over three suitcases and a drunk, I fall face flat on the floor. As I
crawl my way out through the Doors of Illumination into the darkness
on [Moorgate's][moorgate] platform, I jealously look up, straight into
the new entrants' eyes. Such hope, such happiness, such health!

Damn, where's my Oyster card?
