There's never been a better time for
posers to be ourselves. In that spirit,
let us, if you don't mind,
disclose a couple of pleasurable aspects of our
lives. Not exactly [Insta](https://www.boredpanda.com/men-imitate-women-instagram-bros-being-basic/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic)
material, but what
the heck? No one knows we're a boomer anyway.

## Having an alter ego

Oscar Wilde, cofounder of [Kilty Pleasures](https://www.pinterest.com/trevor7171/kilty-pleasures/), famously wrote:

> Give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth

Can't argue with that.

## Non-PC comedy

Parental advisory: certain comments in this video may come across as patronizing to people with bad taste and questionable ethics.

Or rather see for yourself.

## Cheesy love songs

Definitely something one can never be guilty enough of.

## RSCA forever

Granted, [my team][rsca] are going through a difficult period.
Maybe this motivational video can help.

## Choir member memories

No decent church service without dressed-up cisgender persons in possession of male reproductive organs doing theatrical stuff. Kinda looks meaningful and serious.
Might just as well be good for a laugh.

If God exists, I'm sure _they_ wouldn't mind.

## The thrill of not being humbled

On [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fdurant/), the world's professional bragging network, there's a viral
tendency of being thrilled and honoured and
humbled and what not when announcing personal achievements. Must be a cultural thing.

Personally, I prefer to [let awesomeness speak
for itself][fbh], non diluted.

Because modesty is the greatest virtue of all.

## Social pronouns

Who am I / who are we to unilaterally release my/our own personal pronouns to the rest of the world? I/we'd much rather have other people decide that for me/us.

After all, isn't gender a _social_ construct?
