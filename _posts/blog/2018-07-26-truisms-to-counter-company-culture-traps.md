# Problem to solve: systemic inertia

Anyone who has spent enough time in a large organization must have witnessed
the tragic power of **systemic inertia**. Even more so when it is
a by-product of its **company culture**.

<figure>

</figure>

Cultural traditionalists &mdash;especially those born in or raised by
the powers that be&mdash; expect, sustain, and even thrive on
status quo for a living. The **inertia** that results from their
long-standing but backward-looking methods and views are euphemistically
repackaged as **strategic sustainability**. This way, they try to rationalize
and justify the status quo. Tragically, they even see themselves as
defenders of the long term.

Assisted by an army of conceptual architects, designers and
other consultants, they spend person centuries and tons of money on
**all-encompassing yet _paper_ visions** of a corporate
future that one day will solve all of today's and tomorrow's problems.

Their motto: _**Just wait and see,
we're almost there!**_ Of course, they never are, and never
will be. For the simple reason that **the as-is world out there keeps moving at a higher speed
than the desired to-be world can be designed** &mdash; let alone realized.

</figure>

In the meantime, among the lower ranks of the organization, people are exposed
to the **daily realities** of business life: a fast changing competitive
landscape, [technological generations that last no more than a couple of years][whattolearnwhen],
and customers demanding reactive solutions, _**now**_. ICT professionals [who take
care of themselves and their career][whattolearnwhen] experiment with [agile
at scale][agileatscale], [holacracy][holacracy], [DevOps][devops], [cloud
computing][cloudcomputing] and other aspects of the [new
normal][newnormal]. 
To fulfill their customers' &mdash; and therefore their own 
&mdash; **need for speed**, they rightfully expect their organization
to act as an adaptive, loosely coupled, self-organized and
self-(re)organizing network of small, autonomous cells.

The **bravest** departments, teams and individuals **don't wait** for corporate
manna to fall out of the sky: they make the **perilous desert journey
from reality to vision** by themselves. While they may
have **no final game plan**, they are driven by strong **intuition, belief and
leadership** &mdash; not necessarily personified by a current member of their formal
management.

# Solution: (partial) culture change

Corporate reality always has many moving parts, so fixing
organizational sclerosis is never a walk in the park. The
undertaking is not for the faint at heart. Especially since
the corporate patient is not supposed to end up on the undertaker's
table.

For what it's worth, here are a
couple of **truisms**, i.e. commonly accepted truths or advice from the
_world out there_. Take them at heart to prevent pernicious
aspects of corporate culture from doing any further harm. _Or not._

So, to whom it may concern:

### #1. Adapt or die

Whether it's your job, your life or your company: nothing lasts for
ever. As evolution has shown, species can survive over thousands of
generations. They do so by "selecting" slight variations in their individuals
lucky enough to have adapted better than others to their changing
environments.
Seen holistically over time and from a distance, it looks as if the species
has survived. Likewise, **in order for a company (culture) to keep on
thriving** across generations, **it needs to adapt** every now and
then. The driver for change, obviously, is the fast-moving political,
socio-economical, business and technological environment. In
organizations that rely on the status quo, aspects of
corporate culture that once were a great asset "suddenly" become a liability.

In today's turbulent times, hanging onto existing company culture can
be reassuring: it gives a &mdash; possibly false! &mdash; sense of security and
control. As said, **the obvious danger is that the environment changes
faster than you culture can afford.** From the ancient civilizations to the
Kodaks and Nokias of this world, the hard learning is this: adapt in time,
or you will die.

<figure>

	alt="Dinosaurs: Oh crap, was that today?"/>
</figure>

Change brings (more) uncertainty, and uncertainty means risk. Nevertheless,
**the biggest risk is not to take enough risk, or not fast
enough**. Reinvent yourself, or someone else will.

### #2. High-priests are just (wo)men in funny dresses

In any long-standing organization, culture is just as much a
matter of emotional experience as of rational learning. That's why it
takes quite a while to fully integrate or assimilate into a new
environment. Unfortunate consequence: **strong cultures take more time to
adapt, i.e. to _unlearn_,** when such becomes a necessity.

Apart from norms, habits and regulations, company culture manifests itself
in the cumulative [**language and vocabulary**][newspeak] that corporate high-priests
create, speak and disseminate among their followers. Cultural
assimilation is complete when the words and their sometimes special
meanings have been internalised to the extent that their usage
_feels_ natural and normal.

Eye-opener: **however important high-priests may look, they are fundamentally just
men or women in funny dresses.** What I mean is: however valuable the high-priests'
statements have been historically, and however much their actions may seem logical to their
followers today, **their methods and techniques are _not necessarily_
adapted to tomorrow's problems.** 

<figure>
	<img src="/images/highpriests.jpg" alt="High-priests"/>
</figure>

To give cultural change a chance, **it is vital
to _unmask_ the high-priests, and replace a sufficient number of
them** with people who can credibly represent the next cultural
wave.

### #3. Don't just _allow_ Agile and DevOps: _embrace_ them

Any software professional who hasn't been asleep for the last ten to fifteen
years, knows that the [**Agile Movement**][agilemanifesto], the [**DevOps approach**][devops] and related
initiatives have profoundly changed the nature of the ICT profession,
across all industries. In these times of digital transformation,
jumping onto these trains is an absolute **no-brainer** &mdash; which
doesn't mean it's an easy task.

	title="DevOps is a culture, not a role!">Source: Irma
	Kornilova. DevOps is a culture, not a role!</a></figcaption>
</figure>

**High-priests** who proclaim that their followers are **not ready (yet)** for
Agile, DevOps and the like, therefore totally miss the mark. They probably mean
that _they themselves_ are **not able and/or willing to 
adapt** &mdash; proving on the spot that they never will be.

Simple advice: Don't listen to them, and **do the right thing**.

### #4. Meet less, decide more

The number and quality of decisions is inversely proportional to the
number of meeting platforms and participants involved in making
them. In that spirit, I would strongly advise to:

- abolish any meeting platform that fails to gather at least half
  of its participants three times in a row
- never attend an agenda-less meeting: it is probably useless anyway

Some people justify the large number of meetings and meeting attendants by
the need to create **broad support** throughout the
organization. Which in turn  is supposed to facilitate
speedy execution after the decision is made.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/dilbert_4_hour_meeting.jpg"
	alt="Dilbert: 4 hour meeting"/>
</figure>

In my experience, however, the "let's get everyone on board up-front" approach
boils down to to a **self-inflicted veto power mechanism**, as seen for
example in the [United Nations Security Council][un_veto] or the
[Council of the European Union][eu_veto]. When world matters are at
stake, thoughtful stability may make sense; when companies need to make
and execute decisions fast, **veto power kills progress**.

### #5. Think networks, not hyperdimensional spaces

There is a good reason why MBA students all over the world are
commonly exposed to [Boston Consulting Group's 2x2
matrices][bcg2x2]: that seems to be the maximum number of dimensions
that ordinary mortals &mdash;including those same students, of
course&mdash; are able to visually digest.

An "intelligent" yet static design of an organization that requires its
members to think in **three dimensions or more**, stretches their mental
capabilities: it makes it **too hard for
collaborators to understand their own place** in the
organization. Indeed, as more and more conceptual dimensions are
added, the number of possible paths and connections through the
organizational and terminological search space grows
exponentially. Result: people can't see the woods for the trees anymore.

**[Complex, adaptable organisms and organizations][cas]** _are_ able to
prosper and function, though: examples from nature and biology abound.
The condition is that the individual cells that make them up only
need to know three things: **their own purpose, that of their immediate
dependents, and (possibly) which services their dependees use.** How
the cells want to operate **internally, is for them &mdash;and only
them&mdash; to decide.**

[Jeff Bezos' famous
2002 API mandate][jeff_bezos_mandate] is brilliant because it applies
the principle of **information abstraction** to **teams _and_ information
systems** in one symbiotic go. To the outside world, the only thing
that matters are 
the **services** offered, with a description of **inputs and outputs**, based on a
**common information exchange protocol** (e.g. [REST][rest]). From the inside, each team gets a
mandate to pick whatever technology suits them best to implement their
mission. There is no further need to get permissions from central
boards or other kinds of people with veto power.

[Amazon][amazon] and any massively deployed microservice-based
software application demonstrate, paradoxically so, the structural
principles of our era: **more complex yet less complicated**
organizations that organize themselves around simple principles, allow
for **more adaptability, flexibility and growth.** 

### #6. Use generally available, state-of-the-art IT

The more complicated an organization is (re)designed and (re)built, the harder
it is for its collaborators to find who is responsible for
what. **[State of the art enterprise search][enterprise_search] technology** becomes even more
important then. The time when a company could develop a competitive
advantage by building its own core information sharing systems lies
at least two decades behind us: Google was founded in 1998.

Today's knowledge workers are used to finding **relevant information in
fractions of a second**. That's not only true for millennials, by the way.

On the information storage and processing side, [the cloud debate is
over][clouddebate] too. **There is no need to build and push your own cart, when you
can rent and drive someone else's ten-ton truck.** If you _really must_ have
your own, then buy one. That is, if you have the time.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYGQcmZUTaw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

But first and foremost, hire and train your proverbial truck drivers!
_They_ are the new bottleneck. 


### #7. Want to innovate? Build the path to production

To play the **innovation game**, many companies feel the need to
externalize their efforts in so-called **skunkworks or
garages**. There is certainly value in the argument
that internal processes focusing on operational excellence would
easily and immediately kill off any innovative approach. Backed by rules 
and regulations, corporate process watchers are very
skilled indeed at fighting off non-compliant behaviour.

So from a short-term point of view, this makes some sense. In the longer run,
however, there is **more value** in a fundamental revision of the rules
and regulations that govern the **core company information processes**
themselves.

Simply stated, companies need to make the following **structural changes**:

- less centralized control, more trust in distributed knowledge and skills (see fewer meetings)
- fewer committees, more self-organization and devolution of decision power (see Agile)
- fewer hand-overs from silo to silo, more customer-focused end-to-end thinking and automation (see DevOps)
- organize the company in terms of customer-focused value paths, that stream through networks of autonomous cells. Somewhat like physical goods that pass swiftly through a supply chain (see complex systems)
- less top-down and idealistic descriptions of hyperdimensional organizations with roles and functions, more focus on locally decided purpose, self-development and self-determination (see my other post on [what to learn when and why][whattolearnwhen])
- think less in terms of projects and portfolios. **Bring work to (networks of) (teams of) people, rather than people to work**

In short: rent, buy and/or build the **innovation highway to
production** _first_: your ten-ton truck drivers will step forward,
and use it.

**Wanna bet?**
