Being [in-between jobs](/blog/changing-course/) for a (short) while, I spent the leap day yesterday at the
[Open Belgium conference][odb_2016] in Antwerp. The announcement of the federal [Open Data strategy][ods]
in December 2015 has raised new expectations in the Belgian open data community. So, how are we doing?

During the opening panel discussion, [Fedict][fedict] Innovation Manager [Christine Copers][ccopers]
warned that the shift to open government data is not going to happen overnight. Take for example the 
the [National Geographic Institute][ngi]. From its [2013 yearly report][ngi2013_yr], we learn that more than 15%
of annual income is self-originated. At this moment, giving away map data for free without direct monetary compensation
seems like a no-go.

Yet all is not lost. Since 1999, the Flemish authorities have invested €93 million into the development of the Large-Scale
(Geographical) Reference Database. Keeping this database up to date requires another €7 million per annum. Nevertheless,
in December 2015, the database was made freely available under the [Gratis Open Data Licentie Vlaanderen][godlv]. A simple registration
is all that's required. The open map data have recently supported the creation of
a map of available youth space in the Flemish region. Local youth organizations including [Chiro Vlaanderen][chiro] and
[Scouts en Gidsen Vlaanderen][scoutsengidsen] are contributing themselves to create this extra layer, to their own benefit and that of society
at large.

As a regular attendee - or should I say spectator - of [my own municipality council][gemeenteraaddilbeek],
I participated actively in a brainstorm session on open data use cases
for local government. One topic was proactive transparency in local decision making.
What if the complete process leading to a local council decision was public by default,
and open for Wikipedia-style amendments by any citizen or other stakeholder? Even though the final vote would
still be made by elected representatives,
much of its quality lies in how it was prepared. Civic engagement platforms like [CitizenLab][citizenlab] are available *right now*
to serve as modern communication bridges between municipalities and citizens. To prevent reinvention of
the wheel, Flemish organizations like [VVSG][vvsg] and [V-ICT-OR][victor] can (read: must) play a coordinating
and facilitating role here, without doing all the work themselves. Even more so, because municipal budgets are scarcer than ever.

Data journalist [Maarten Lambrechts](http://www.maartenlambrechts.be/) listed do's and don'ts
for data publishers like [Eurostat][eurostat], [OECD][oecd], [Statistics Belgium][statbel]
or any other local data provider.
As a data exchange format, PDFs are evil. As a story inducer, aggregate figures like the mean are useless.
To give journalists and their graphic collaborators an incentive to comment on your data and graphs, make sure
they can be easily recreated straight from the source. For complex data that require more time to handle, an embargo
works just fine. To see what's possible when all these conditions are met, check out this [interactive map of
daily commuters in Belgium][dailycommuters].

The maxim "open your data and they will come and build" has not yet been proven in the (Belgian) field.
Nevertheless, success will keep on depending on the collaboration between (governmental) publishers and users. 
In a data publication project, elaborate requirements, specifications and cost estimates are not the way to go.
A better approach is to start small, and work iteratively towards on-the-spot discovery
of new uses and applications, which may in turn lead to new data requirements.
To promote this agile approach, large government agencies and institutions need a cultural change in the way they handle
public procurement - if only to give start-ups in this field a reasonable chance to win their first deals.
