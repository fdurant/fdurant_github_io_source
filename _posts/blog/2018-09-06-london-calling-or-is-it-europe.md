In the winter of 1990-1991, while studying computer science and [natural
language processing][nlp] at the [University of Essex][essexuni], I spent my first
weekend ever in London. [Margaret Thatcher][margaretthatcher]'s 15-year service as Prime Minister
in Her Majesty's Government had just come to a dramatic end.

The Iron Lady left Downing Street just a year after [the Iron Curtain
fell][schabowski]. Back in the idyllic [Ardleigh Park Lodge][ardleigh] in Essex, I saw my
German housemate [Matthias][matthias_jaeschke] cast his vote in the first
all-German multi-party elections since [1933][1933]. The other student in the
house was [Anne-Marie][anne-marie_mineur], nowadays Member of the
European Parliament for the [Dutch Socialistische Partij][sp_nl].

We were young, we were Europeans in England, and the times were historic.

And then, a quarter century later, there was Brexit.

True, I may be skipping a few life events here, like: getting
married and daughters; buying a house; starting and ending a dozen of
jobs. The fact is: like Marcel Proust's mind wandered off to his
madeleines, Brexit threw me back to that snowy winter.

And now, half a year before the United Kingdom is set to leave the
European Union, I'm going back. Back to England. Back to London!

What's more: not just on a visit.

Next Monday, I start as Sr. Data Scientist
at [Aire Labs][aire_labs] in [Shoreditch][east_london_tech_city], just north of [the City of
London][city_of_london]. Aire is, in its own words, "a new
credit assessment service" that helps "lenders make more informed
decisions, and borrowers get fairer access to credit".

I will be commuting from Brussels to London on a weekly basis
(Monday-Friday). Weekends will be spent at home, with wife and daughters, as
usual.

I sometimes dream of meeting the Brexit negotiators &mdash;my fellow
travellers&mdash; on the Eurostar. In the lounge or the restaurant
coach, I would tell them this story. And invite them for a beer. Or,
in my case, a [pint][pint] of semi-skimmed milk.

For old times' sake.
