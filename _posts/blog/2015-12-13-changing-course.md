People come, people go.

Earlier this week, I resigned from speech & language company [Nuance Communications][nuance], and signed at [Colruyt Group][colruyt-group].

For my foreign friends: [Colruyt Group][colruyt-group] is Belgium's largest food
retailer - among other things - with a 24.7% local market share (source: [gondola.be][gondola]). 

From mid-March 2016 on, I'll be mining Colruyt's vast data resources,
in search for actionable insights and innovative applications.

I can't be very specific at this moment,
but [text mining][text-mining] and [process mining][process-mining] will likely be on my radar. While
I did some work on [(biological) text mining][ua-biomint] before - it's a classical subdiscipline of [Natural
Language Processing][nlp] - process mining is rather new to me. Which makes it all
the more exciting, of course. I'm already reading an [introductory
book][process-mining-book] and taking the [Coursera course][process-mining-course].

Looking forward to 2016!
